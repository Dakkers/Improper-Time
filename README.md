##Summary

A sidescroller being written by myself (Dakota St. Laurent), Ali "Frodo" Ramadhan and Sankarshan "Chunky" Mudkavi, with 
graphics by Jason "AJ" Liu. Or something like that. The game is being written in Python using the pyglet game module, 
the physics engine pymunk, and probably the sprite module rabbyt.
